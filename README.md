# Mod 2 Week 5 Assessment

Start by Forking this repo.

## Questions (10 Points Possible)

1. In at least two sentences, how would you define what seed data is and why it's useful? (1 point possible)
Seed data is what a developer might put into a database intitally to test if the database works as expected. It allows the devleoper to work out any bugs or issues that may arise without worring about loosing important data. 
1. Deleting a database column is a dangerous action, what might happen if you delete a column you didn't mean to? (1 point possible)
the first thing that could happen is that you would loose all data inside of that column. Depending on whether or not that column was a foreign or primary key it could also mess up relationships between tables. Lastly depending on were you delete the column it could cause the application and database to become out of sync.
1. Write out at least 3 steps to describe the process of adding a new column to your database using entity framework. (1 point possible)
    First you will want to add a new property to the model you are trying to add the column to. After that's done you will want to navigate to the NuGet package manager console and add a migration with add-migration. Here you can enter in a name for the migration ideally the name of what you are adding. Lastly, you will want to run update-database to apply the newest snapshot to your database
    
1. When I run `Update-Database`, which function in the migration is used `Up` or `Down`? (1 point possible)
the 'up' function is used
1. When was Entity Framework Core version 7.0 released? As always, feel free to use google as a resource in answering this question. (1 point possible)
according to a post by Arthur Vickers on devblogs.microsoft.com EF Core 7.0 was released on November 8th, 2022
1. True or False: When using Entity Framework to create database tables for a many-to-many relationship, you must create a class to represent the join table? Explain your answer. (1 point possible) FALSE. while cretaing a class to act as a join table will work, it is not mandatory. Entity Framework has the ability to create a join table automatically using a list of the other class in both classes that you are trying to create a join table for

1. Replace the ____________s with the code required to create the models required for the following entity relationship diagram. Don't worry about `Routeid` vs `RoutesId` and `Stopid` vs `StopsId`, either is fine. Also, no need to include the `terminus` column. (2 points possible)

```C#
namespace BusTransitApp
    {
        public class Route
        {
            public float Fare {get; set;}
            public List<Stop> Stop {get; set;} = new();
        }
    }

namespace BusTransitApp
    {
        public class Stop
        {
            public string Name {get; set;}
            public List<Route> Route {get; set;} = new();
        }
    }
```


1. Replace the _______________s with the code required to seed at least two `Route` objects and at least two `Stop` objects based on your models above. Make sure that there is a many-to-many relationship between your data. (2 points possible)

```C#
namespace BusTransitApp.Data
{
    public class DataSeeder
    {
        public static void SeedRoutesAndStops(BusTransitContext context)
        {
            if (true)
            {
                Route route1 = new Route{Fare = 2.25}
                Route route2 = new Route{Fare = 1.25}
                Stop stop1 = new Stop{name =" union station", Route = new List<Route> { route1 } };
                Stop stop2 = new Stop{name = "Colfax", Route = new List<Route> { route2 } };

                
                Context.Add(route1);
                Context.Add(route2);
                Context.Add(stop1);
                Context.Add(stop2);
                
                Context.SaveChanges();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
## Exercise (10 Points Possible)

Clone your forked copy of this repository into Visual Studio.  

In this solution, there is a project that has already been set up using Entity Framework.

**Goal 1**: Create your concert database without changing the models. You will need to modify the project to include your specific postgress password, then create a migration, then update your database.

Delivarable: In your slack message to instructors, include a screenshot of the ERD for your concerts table in pgAdmin to show you have completed this step.

**Goal 2**: Add a performers table to your database. Implement a many-to-many relationship between concerts and performers. It's up to you what fields your performers table includes, but it should have at least 3 fields.

Deliverable: In your slack message to instructors, include a screenshot of the ERD for your concerts and performers tables in pgAdmin to show you have completed this step.

## Extra Challenge (0 Points Possible)

Add some seed data for performers and concerts.

## Submission

When finished:
* Commit your changes in Visual Studio
* Push up to GitHub
* Submit the link to your forked repository in the submission form posted in slack!
